// 1. Declare an empty array and store it in a variable.

// 2. Now check the type of empty array you declared above.

// 3. Create an array named `colors` that contains five different names of colors as strings.

// 4. Access the first color in the array and print it to the console using `console.log()`

// 5. Access the third color in the array and print it to the console using `console.log()`

// 6. Access the last color in the array and print it to the console using `console.log()`

// 7. Write one line of code that changes the value of the first color in the list to "black" (overwriting the previous value).

// 8. Write one line of code that changes the value of the last color in the list to "ultraviolet" (overwriting the previous value).

// 9. Now, Find the length of the array named `colors`.

// 10. Create a new variable called fourthColor and set it equal to the fourth color in the list.

// 11. Add another color to the end of the list.

// 12. Add another color to the beginning of the list (use array method array.unshift('gray'))

// 13. Remove the first color from the starting of the array

// 14. Remove the last color from the end of list, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.

// 15. Remove the second color from the end of list.

// 16. Write a for loop to iterate through every element in the array and print each element to the console.

// 17. Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every color's value and every color's index in this format: 3, purple or 0, blue etc.

// 18. Write a for..of loop to iterate through every element in the array and print each element to the console.

// 19. Create a variable named lastColor that will always point to the last element of the colors array, no matter how many colors are in the list. (Hint: make use of the array's length property for this!)

// 20. Add a new color `tomato` to the index 45. And check the length of the array. Use `console.log` to print.
